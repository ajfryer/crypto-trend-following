            100% HODL isn't for everyone

            You know crypto markets boom and bust - You Hold On for Dear Life.
            But did you know you could diversify your HODL?
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike HODL, Trend Following strategies actively manage risk. They
            invest more when prices trend calmly, and less when they don't.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because they perform differently, HODL and Trend Following
            strategies can diversify each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Diversification can smooth your returns and make your overall
              portfolio less susceptible to booms and busts.

            Large Funds Use Trend Following
          </h2>
          <p>
            For decades, multi-billion dollar funds have diversified their
            portfolios with trend following strategies.
          </p>

          <p>
            They start with a diverse universe of many markets. They trend
            follow on every market they can find.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each day, they invest more in markets with stable trends and less
            money in markets with volatile non-trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Over time, their goal is to own big trends and nothing else. You
              can use Trend Following on coins in your crypto portfolio!

            <p>
              Crypto Trend Following is a free site that calculates a trend
              following for you. This site doesn't manage money for you. Click
              Get Started to configure your own strategy.

            <h3>2. Easy Customization</h3>
            <p>
              Customize the "Trend Speed", "volatility", "leverage", and
              "shorting" of your trend following strategy. If you aren't sure
              what to choose, click the "Starter Strategy" button.

            <p>
              Trend Following doesn't have to be 100% of your crypto portfolio
              because it can help diversify your existing portfolio. Add as
              little or as much Trend Following as you want.
